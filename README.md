Data to convert Ordnance Survey grid references to vice-counties

This repository contains data that can be used to convert grid references to vice-counties. The data can not be used "as is". In order to reduce the size of the data files, a hierarchical system has been implemented whereby if a grid square is entirely within one vice-county, all "child" grid squares are omitted. Thus, in order to retrieve the correct conversion, if the grid square doesn't exist in the data, you need to test the "parent" grid reference.

As an example, grid square TF135384 does not exist in the data files because it's "grandparent" (it's "parent", TF13 is also absent) is entirely within vice-county 53. When traversing the hierachy, you must test in the following order 1m > 10m > 100m > 1km > 2km > 10km > 100km, ignoring the 5km grid square as this does not entirely contain any "child" grid squares.

Psuedocode:
```
input = TF135384

if exists input then
  return vc(input)
else
  if exists convert_to_1m(input) then
    return vc(convert_to_1m(input))
  else
    if exists convert_to_10m(input) then
      return vc(convert_to_10m(input))
    else
      if exists convert_to_100m(input) then
        return vc(convert_to_100m(input))
      else
        if exists convert_to_1km(input) then
          return vc(convert_to_1km(input))
        else
          if exists convert_to_2km(input) then
            return vc(convert_to_2km(input))
          else
            if exists convert_to_10km(input) then
              return vc(convert_to_10km(input))
            else
              if exists convert_to_100km(input) then
                return vc(convert_to_100km(input))
              else
                return "no vice-county"
```
